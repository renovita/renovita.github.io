# Specialisation vs Generalisation

How useful is it to study one subject broadly, against studying multiple subjects to a lesser extent? It mainly depends on how much lesser that extent is I suppose.

At a university level, I have now studied some Chemistry, some Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. As I now have to think about what career I'm going to follow after studying finishes soon the usefulness of this broad range is something I want to think about.

The propensity for a broad range started in school. When I got to university I was suprised to hear my new peers talk about A levels and only taking three or four subjects. I went through the European Baccalaureate instead, and the number of subjects barely diminished throughout the years there.

There are a lot of benefits going through the European School system. True to its nature there was a great melting pot of students from different backgrounds and countries, with different teachers having different styles. Of course this also had its downsides - switching between the wildly stricter and looser essay styles ; also the school had a tendancy to follow the famous EU red tape which resulted in some good teachers not being able to stay for long enough.

But the main thing the school has going for it is the broad approach. In the final year before university, I was studying not just the Maths, Physics and Chemistry my potential university wanted, but also English, French, Philosophy - and History and Geogrpahy taught in French! And that many subjects was the norm. They may not have been subjects required to study at Nottingham but they were still worthwhile for keeping a level head and open mind.

At Nottingham my subject was Natural Sciences. This is in essence a delaying tactic, where you study three scince subjects in first year, the two in the next two years and one if you do the integrated master's fourth year. Perhaps this wasn't the soundest idea - most of my Chemistry knowledge has left me since then. However, it was good for meeting different people. I made friends among the physics students, and among the Natural Sciences students, and there was far more diversity in thought and approach among the latter. In particular I was taken aback by the dismissive attitute to philosophy taken by so many of the physics bunch.

It was the same when I moved on to the University of Kent to do a conversion course to Computer Science. There is such a variety among conversion students. Whilst I did Maths, my new friends had done degrees in Law, and Psychology. The whole approach was so open, and helpful to each other. My humanities based friends could help me in writing reports, and organising group work, while I could help them in subjects such as Logic programming.

So I have touched upon the usefulness of a diverse peer group. But that is not the sole benefit. The purpose of learning is not memorisation, and hasn't been for a while. It is far more important to have the structure upon which knowledge can be placed. For example, when I got to Nottingham I found there were things quite a few other people knew that I didn't - although whether this was due to a deeper study or simply a different curriculum is still uncertain. But a student's spare time is meant for studying, and anything I lacked didn't take too long to make up. In contrast there were one or two students who complained about being expected to study outside of lectures!

So while it may be a few years since I studied philosophyat school the structure is still there. I have forgotten particular facts but when I come across new concepts it is not too hard to put them in place. It also stops me slipping into one way of thinking about things.

If you have a huge amount of knowledge about one specific thing that can be very useful - if that's your job then you can do it very effectively. But not everyone who studies a subject makes a career out of it. If that is the case having muliple structures and base knowledge is much more important than specifics. Some of the physics students could recite multiple physical constants to more decimal places than would ever be needed. But that sort of knowledge can be looked up in seconds. Far more important is understanding the context.
