[Morning News](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/morning-news/) is an add-on for Firefox I've been working on to keep up routines.
How it works is it takes a list of websites (which is completely customisable) and opens them the first time the browser is opened each day.
The main use is as a handy way to check the news, but it can also be used as a way to keep habits going, such as a daily Duolingo check, which is included by default.

To edit the list simply click the icon in the taskbar and either click add to add the current site to the list or on a trash can to delete a site.
